#The Adventures of Young Walt Whitman

The Adventures of Young Walt Whitman is a 'choose-your-own-adventure' style game about the fictionalized adventures of Walt Whitman attempting to get his creation, the "American Bible", *Leaves of Grass* published. 

Gameplay revolves around the user (player) viewing a page of the story and choosing from the options available to her. Each option provides a link to a new story page and new options. Also, some pages contain objects which the player can collect (by dragging to their inventory) and ise to interect with other objects in the game world.

Dependecies are few: [impress.js](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored).
